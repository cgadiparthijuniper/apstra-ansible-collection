short_description: Manage Apstra blueprints
description:
  - Create, commit, lock, unlock, and delete Apstra blueprints.
  - Run graph queries (QE) to discover nodes and interfaces within
    a blueprint using C(state=queried).
  - Patch individual node properties such as system_id and deploy_mode
    using C(state=node_updated).
  - Run commit checks (dry-run validation) and collect build errors
    and deploy diagnostics using C(state=commit_check).
  - The QE query and node utilities are also available as importable
    helpers in C(module_utils/apstra/bp_query.py) and
    C(module_utils/apstra/bp_nodes.py) for use by other modules.

## Getting Started (New to Ansible?)

If you have never used Ansible before, this section explains the minimum you need to know to start automating Apstra with this collection.

### What Is Ansible?

Ansible is an agentless automation tool. You write **playbooks** — plain YAML files that describe what you want done — and Ansible executes them against a target system. No agent needs to be installed on the target; Ansible talks to Apstra over its REST API directly from your laptop or CI runner.

### Key Concepts

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Playbook** | A YAML file containing one or more automation tasks |
| **Task** | A single action, e.g. "create a security zone" |
| **Module** | The code behind each task — this collection provides 20+ Apstra-specific modules |
| **Variable** | A reusable value referenced in playbooks as `{{ variable_name }}` |
| **Register** | Saves a task's output to a variable for use in later tasks |

### Step 1 — Install Ansible and This Collection

```bash
# Install Ansible (Python 3.12 recommended)
pip install ansible-core>=2.16.16

# Install the collection from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy collection install juniper.apstra

# Or install directly from this repo
git clone https://github.com/Juniper/apstra-ansible-collection.git
cd apstra-ansible-collection
make setup
pipenv shell
```

### Step 2 — Set Your Apstra Credentials

Create a `.env` file (or export these as environment variables):

```bash
export APSTRA_API_URL="https://<your-apstra-host>/api"
export APSTRA_USERNAME="admin"
export APSTRA_PASSWORD="your-password"
export APSTRA_VERIFY_CERTIFICATES=0   # set to 1 in production
```

### Step 3 — Write Your First Playbook

A playbook is just a YAML file. Here is a minimal example that logs in to Apstra, creates a security zone (VRF) in a blueprint, and logs out:

```yaml
# my_first_playbook.yml
---
- name: Create a security zone in Apstra
  hosts: localhost        # runs locally — no SSH needed
  gather_facts: false
  connection: local

  vars:
    blueprint_id: "your-blueprint-id-here"

  tasks:

    # Step 1: Log in and get a session token
    - name: Authenticate to Apstra
      juniper.apstra.authenticate:
        verify_certificates: false
      register: auth            # saves the result (including token) to 'auth'

    # Step 2: Create a security zone (VRF)
    - name: Create security zone 'blue'
      juniper.apstra.security_zone:
        id:
          blueprint: "{{ blueprint_id }}"
        body:
          label: "blue"
          vrf_name: "blue"
          sz_type: "evpn"
        auth_token: "{{ auth.token }}"
        state: present

    # Step 3: Commit the blueprint to deploy changes
    - name: Commit blueprint
      juniper.apstra.blueprint:
        id:
          blueprint: "{{ blueprint_id }}"
        state: committed
        lock_state: unlocked
        auth_token: "{{ auth.token }}"

    # Step 4: Log out
    - name: Logout
      juniper.apstra.authenticate:
        auth_token: "{{ auth.token }}"
        logout: true
```

### Step 4 — Run It

```bash
ansible-playbook my_first_playbook.yml
```

You should see output like:

```
PLAY [Create a security zone in Apstra] ***************************

TASK [Authenticate to Apstra] *************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create security zone 'blue'] ********************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Commit blueprint] *******************************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Logout] *****************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************
localhost : ok=4  changed=3  unreachable=0  failed=0
```

Running the same playbook again will show `ok` (not `changed`) for the security zone task — this is **idempotency**, a core Ansible principle meaning "only change what needs changing."

### Step 5 — Explore More Modules

Every module in this collection follows the same pattern:

```yaml
- name: <description>
  juniper.apstra.<module_name>:
    id:
      blueprint: "{{ blueprint_id }}"   # required for blueprint-scoped modules
    body:
      <module-specific parameters>
    auth_token: "{{ auth.token }}"
    state: present    # present | absent | committed | queried | gathered
```

See [ansible_collections/juniper/apstra/README.md](ansible_collections/juniper/apstra/README.md) for the full module reference, and the [tests/](ansible_collections/juniper/apstra/tests/) directory for working examples of every module.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Juniper/apstra-ansible-collection). See [Contributing to Ansible-maintained collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/contributing_maintained_collections.html) for general guidelines.

## Development Environment

The following tools are recommended for development of this collection:
1. [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) -- Only needed for _Mac OS X_
1. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/README.md)
2. [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
3. [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

> **CPU Instruction Set Requirement:** The Ansible Execution Environment image requires a host CPU that supports the **x86-64-v2** microarchitecture level or higher (Intel Nehalem / AMD Bulldozer and later). Attempting to run the image on an older CPU will result in the error: `Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2`.

### Setup

#### Mac OS X

1. If you're on a Mac and don't have brew, install it:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2. If you have an ARM-based Mac, make sure the following is in your ~/.zprofile:
   ```bash
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```
   For Intel-based Mac, you may have to add this to ~/.zprofile instead:
   ```bash
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```

3. Run the following command to install pyenv:
   ```bash
   brew install xz pyenv
   ```

4. Add this to your ~/.zprofile and restart your shell:
    ```bash
    export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
    [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    ```

#### Linux-based Systems

1. Install pyenv:

    ```bash
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```

2. To set it up in your shell follow these instructions: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#b-set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv

3. On _Ubuntu_, you'll need to install some packages to build Python properly:
      ```bash
      sudo apt -y install build-essential liblzma-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libcrypt-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev
      ```

#### All Systems

1. The Apstra SDK (`aos-sdk-api`) is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aos-sdk-api/) and is installed automatically when you run `make setup`. No manual download is required.

   The SDK version is pinned in `Pipfile`:
   ```toml
   [packages]
   aos-sdk-api = "==6.1.2"
   ```
   Update this version to match your Apstra server version before running `make setup`.

2. Run the setup `make` target:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. Optional: Follow [pipenv command completion setup instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/stable/shell.html#shell-completion). Only do it if pipenv is installed in your global Python interpreter.

### Usage

To use the development environment after setting everything up, simply run the commands:

  ```bash
  pipenv install --dev
  pipenv shell
  ```

This will start a new interactive prompt in which the known supported version of Ansible and required dependencies to use the Apstra SDK is installed.

### Test Configuration

To run tests, you should have an Apstra 5.0 (or later) instance in the lab.

At the root of your 'apstra-ansible-collection' repo, create a .env file. Put the authentication files you need in there. `pipenv` will set these when the pipenv is initialized. Here is an example.

```bash
APSTRA_API_URL="https://apstra-34d9c451-d688-408b-826d-581b963c086e.aws.apstra.com/api"
APSTRA_USERNAME="admin"
APSTRA_PASSWORD="TenaciousFlyingfish1#"
APSTRA_VERIFY_CERTIFICATES=0
```

### Image Build

To build the image, docker is required.

To build an image, you'll need to set the environment variables `RH_USERNAME` and `RH_PASSWORD` in the .env file at the root of your repo.  For example:

```bash
RH_USERNAME=jsmith
RH_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Then `make image` will create an image named `apstra-ee:latest`.

### Image Publish

To publish an image, you'll need to set the REGISTRY_URL in your .env file to point to the location of the docker registry you use to publish Execution Environments. For example:

```bash
REGISTRY_URL=s-artifactory.juniper.net/ee/apstra-ansible-collection
```

Then, simply run `make image` again, and in addition to rebuilding (if needed), the image `apstra-ee:latest` will be tagged and pushed to the location specified in the `REGISTRY_URL`.

### Building/Testing

The following `make` targets are supported to build, install and test an ansible galaxy package.

|Target|Purpose|
|---|---|
|setup|Setup the build/test execution environment.|
|build|Create package `juniper-apstra-$(VERSION).tar.gz.`|
|install|Install package `juniper-apstra-$(VERSION).tar.gz.`|
|image|Build an execution environment (container) image `apstra-ee:latest`, and optionally tag/publish if `REGISTRY_URL` is set.|
|test|Test the collection.|
|clean|Clean up created files.|
|release-build|Force rebuilding the collection for release.|
|pipenv|Setup the pipenv used for developement and execution.|
|clean-pipenv|Clean the pipenv used for development and execution.|


### Debugging

Debugging Ansible modules in VSCode is easy. Simply use the `Debug: Ansible Module` debug configuration. To use it:

1. Be sure to have a `.env` file as described in the [Test Configuration](#test-configuration) section.
1. Open the code for the module you wish to debug in VS Code.
2. Set your breakpoint as needed.
3. _OPTIONAL:_ Create a `module_args/<your_module>.json` file with your (optional) additional parameters to debug. For example, here's a `module_args/authenticate.json` to debug the `authenticate` module:
    ```json
    {
      "ANSIBLE_MODULE_ARGS": {
        "logout": false
      }
    }
    ```
4. Hit the green button!

### Using the Apstra SDK in the Ansible Collection

Here's an example of how the Apstra SDK can be used to perform CRUD operations.

```python
        # Instantiate the client
        client_factory = ApstraClientFactory.from_params(module)
        client = client_factory.get_l3clos_client()

        # Gather facts using the persistent connection

        # Get /api/version
        version = client.version.get()

        # Get /api/blueprints
        blueprints = client.blueprints
        blueprints_list = blueprints.list()
        blueprints_map = {blueprint['id']: blueprint for blueprint in blueprints_list}

        # prepare the blueprint query
        blueprint = client.blueprints['941660a1-2967-4550-ae3b-04d6d9fd71b4']
        # get the blueprint data
        bp_data = blueprint.get()

        # prepare the security zone query
        security_zone = blueprint.security_zones['hJR2j7ExBhEHgWE2Cbg']
        # get the security zone data
        sz_data = security_zone.get()

        # update the security zone data
        sz_data['label'] = 'Default routing zone EDWIN WUZ HERE'
        security_zone.update(sz_data)

        # get the updated security zone data
        sz_data_updated = security_zone.get()

        # update the security zone data back to the original
        sz_data['label'] = 'Default routing zone'
        security_zone.update(sz_data)

        # create a new security zone
        Routing_Zone_Name = "Example_RZ"
        new_sz = blueprint.security_zones.create(data={
            "vrf_name": "{}".format(Routing_Zone_Name),
            # "vni_id": 90000,
            "vrf_description": "vrf desc for {}".format(Routing_Zone_Name),
            "sz_type": "evpn",
            "label": "{}".format(Routing_Zone_Name)
        })

        # get the security zone
        new_sz_check = blueprint.security_zones[new_sz['id']].get()

        # delete the security zone
        blueprint.security_zones[new_sz['id']].delete()
```

### Locking the Blueprint

The Terraform plugin implementation provides a model for how we will lock the blueprint during plays. See [Blueprint Mutex Documentation](https://github.com/Juniper/terraform-provider-apstra/blob/main/kb/blueprint_mutex.md)
